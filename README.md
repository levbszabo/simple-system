# Simplified Operating System
Four components of a standard operating system are implemented: Linking, CPU(Process) Scheduling, Virtual Memory Management, I/O scheduling (disk). Due to the complexity of a real operating system all of these concepts are simplified to provide my own personal understanding at the cost of its functionality. 


note: These were components of work done for the graduate operating systems course at NYU.
